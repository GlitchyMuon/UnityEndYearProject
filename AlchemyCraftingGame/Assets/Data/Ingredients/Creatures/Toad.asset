  <Description>k__BackingField: "I\u2019m sure when you picture a Toad you see a
    wrinkly, brown, ugly creature. In reality, these frogs come in a variety of shapes,
    sizes, and colors. Ok, some species are admittedly a tad ugly, but they are all
    unique in their own way.\nThese amphibians are part of the taxonomic order Anura
    that makes up the frog family. However, they differ from other frogs in the texture
    of their skin. Toads have dry, leather-like skin, while frogs have moist, semi-permeable
    skin."
