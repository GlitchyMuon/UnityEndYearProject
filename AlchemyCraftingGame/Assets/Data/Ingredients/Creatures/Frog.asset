  <Description>k__BackingField: "Frogs aren't distinguishable by their size (don't
    think that a big frog is a toad !)\nThe biggest frog in the world is the Goliath
    frog. It lives in West Africa and can measure more than a foot in length and
    weigh more than 7 pounds \u2013 as much as a newborn baby.\nIn general, frogs
    have protruding eyes, no tail, and strong, webbed hind feet that are adapted
    for leaping and swimming. They also possess smooth, moist skins. Many are predominantly
    aquatic, but some live on land, in burrows, or in trees.\nA frog completely sheds
    its skin about once a week. After it pulls off the old, dead skin, the frog usually
    eats it."
