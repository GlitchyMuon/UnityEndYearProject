  <Description>k__BackingField: In the shadowy realms of mystic symbolism, the Corvus
    birds, guardians of ancient secrets, embody insight and intelligence. Cloaked
    in glossy plumage that glistens like the midnight sky, these winged soothsayers
    traverse the veil between worlds with a keen perception that pierces the darkness.
    Their eyes, windows to the ethereal, reflect the cosmic wisdom they carry. Often
    revered as messengers from unseen realms, Corvus birds are harbingers of transformation
    and change. In the whispers of their cawing, one may discern the secrets of the
    universe, for they are the keepers of mystic knowledge, soaring through the tapestry
    of time with an otherworldly grace.
