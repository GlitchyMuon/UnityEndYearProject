  <Description>k__BackingField: In the enchanted lore of botanical wonders, Tulsi
    leaves emerge as mystical guardians of hair vitality. Harvested from sacred basil
    plants, these verdant jewels are known to weave a spell of rejuvenation upon
    tresses. When dried and transformed into an elixir, the essence of Tulsi unveils
    a magical potion for hair care. With whispers of ancient secrets, this potion,
    when applied, sparks upon strands, bestowing a lustrous sheen and a touch of
    botanical enchantment. Tulsi, the guardian of locks, is said to weave a tapestry
    of strength, ensuring that every strand is cradled in the embrace of natural
    radiance and mystical resilience.
