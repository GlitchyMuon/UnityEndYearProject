  <Description>k__BackingField: In the enchanted apothecary, mint emerges as a digestive
    sorcerer. Plucked beneath the moon's glow, its leaves craft elixirs that whisper
    of balance. Mint, the healer of the digestive kingdom, is a guardian of well-being,
    ensuring that every sip or nibble becomes a magical journey of comfort and serenity,
    as it soothes the belly's turbulent seas, for those who partake in its herbal
    symphony.
