  <Description>k__BackingField: Behold the Time-Twist Thyme, a sprig plucked from
    the continuum's edge. Cultivated where the threads of past and future intertwine,
    this enchanted herb is a time-bending maestro. Infused with the whispers of temporal
    secrets, the Time-Twist Thyme lends its essence to potions with a flicker of
    the ages. As it twirls in the brew, it weaves a chrono-dance, infusing concoctions
    with a taste of the ages. Sip cautiously, for the Time-Twist Thyme holds the
    power to add a temporal twist to every spell it graces, a herbaceous portal to
    the mysteries of time itself.
