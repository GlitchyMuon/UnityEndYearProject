  <Description>k__BackingField: 'In the magical realm of natural hair care, the enchanting
    ritual begins by harvesting the fruit pods, leaves, and bark of a mystical plant.
    These sacred ingredients are carefully dried, ground into a powder, and transformed
    into a whimsical paste. Unlike ordinary shampoos with their mundane lather, this
    sacred concoction, while not frothy, possesses potent cleansing powers. With
    a gentle touch and a naturally low pH, it dances on hair, leaving behind the
    essence of enchantment without stripping away precious natural oils. Legends
    speak of using an infusion of the leaves to banish the mischievous flakes of
    dandruff, ensuring a crowning glory fit for a fairy tale.

    Traditionnally
    used for shampoo since 4500-4300 years ago.'
