  <Description>k__BackingField: "\rUlexite, also known as TV rock or television stone,
    activates the third eye and enhances inner visions, imagination, and creativity.
    It reveals truths and energies previously unnoticed, providing knowledge about
    one's true self and activating telepathic abilities through meditation or deep
    sleep. Additionally, Ulexite serves as a mental enhancer, accelerating decision-making
    and aiding those engaged in intensive study or memorization, making it easier
    to grasp thoughts and ideas with reduced mental stress."
