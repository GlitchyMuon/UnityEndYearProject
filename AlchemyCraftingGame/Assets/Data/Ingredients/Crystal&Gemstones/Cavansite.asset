  <Description>k__BackingField: 'The powerful energies that radiate off of Cavansite
    help attune us to frequencies of higher dimensions, realms, and beings. Placing
    this stone on your bedside each night before you sleep will help provide clarity
    and understanding of your dreams as well as the images within them. The meaning
    behind these images will help one learn more about themselves and what they are
    truly meant to do in this world. These depictions may be referencing something
    currently happening in your life or are foreshadowing of what may lie ahead.
    This mineral can also assist you in finding your own unique psychic abilities.
    It''s of great importance and strength when one is working towards astral projection
    and lucid dreaming. '
